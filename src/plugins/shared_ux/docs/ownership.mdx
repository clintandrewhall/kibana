At Elastic, we've often relied on the concept of singular "ownership" of a solution, a system, or a collection of code, to determine who is responsible for roadmaps, enhancements, bugs, features, reviews, etc.  The Shared UX team is taking a more explicit, yet nuanced, approach to ownership to promote collaboration and prevent becoming a bottleneck.

## Applying <acronym title="Responsible, Accountable, Contributing, Informed">RACI</acronym> to Shared UX
Shared UX is currently operating under the <acronym title="Responsible, Accountable, Contributing, Informed">RACI</acronym> model.

### Responsible
Shared UX would be responsible for features and code on its roadmap that we've identified as a team.  It's likely the code for these features and solutions would be contained within an entire plugin owned by the team.  We'd write code as well as review code contributed by others to match our patterns and standards.  Examples might include application chrome, navigation, and end-to-end workflows.

### Accountable
In some cases, Shared UX would be accountable for making sure work happens. We may or may not be contributing code to the effort, but will drive progress between relevant teams across releases and raise issues as appropriate.  We'd likely be listed as `CODEOWNER` along with another team.  Examples might include a deprecation or creation of an EUI component, following up on an accessibility audit, identifying bespoke components that should be migrated to a shared component, or notifying teams about a new pattern to follow.

### Contributing
Some efforts won't require us to drive them, but teams would like us to be involved, whether to consult on patterns or to review or edit code.  Contribution might include listing our team as a `CODEOWNER` for a period of time to help gauge progress.  Examples might include new solutions, integration of a complex component (like `CodeEditor`), or conversion to CSS-in-JS or Typescript.

### Informed
Finally, sometimes teams might just want to keep us in the know.  We'd like to be able to share our knowledge and experience with the team, but we'd avoid blocking or being a burden.  This might include any of the above, but isolated to a single solution or effort.
