## Description

This package contains a "theming" context for Kibana.  A corollary to EUI's `EuiThemeProvider`, it uses Kibana services to ensure the EUI Theme is customized correctly.

Up until now, there has been some confusion as to the difference between `EuiThemeProvider` and `EuiProvider`.  They've been used interchangeably, which created some unnoticed
side effects.  In addition, _nesting_ of `EuiThemeProvider` has led to additional nodes being rendered to the DOM.

This context allows us to have a single source of truth for the theme in Kibana, and ensures that the theme is applied correctly.  It also abstracts away any updates or changes
made to the `EuiThemeProvider` in the future.
