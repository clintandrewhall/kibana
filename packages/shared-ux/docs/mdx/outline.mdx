## Outline

This is a working outline for my documentation. It is a work in progress and will likely be updated as I go.

- TL;DR
  - Core Tenets
    - Components should remain stateless until imported
    - Component consumption should not involve the plugin lifecycle
    - Components should define their own contextual API for external services
    - We should be able to develop, test, fix, and showcase components without running Kibana
  - Create containers and pure components
  - Keep components small and useful
  - Use Emotion first
  - Create storybooks/mocks/test for each component
  - Create impl/mock/types packages
- Component Architecture
  - Pure Components and Containers
    - Kibana Dependency Management
    - State Management and Hooks
  - Composition
  - Styling
  - Testing
  - Storybook
  - Packaging
    - Naming Convention
    - impl, mock, and types
  - Documentation
- System Architecture
  - Plugins and the Kibana Lifecycle
  - Packages and Bazel
  - Stateless vs Stateful
    - Packages are Stateless
    - Plugins are Stateful
  - Dependency Management
    - Plugins can depend on other plugins and Packages
    - Packages can only depend on other Packages
